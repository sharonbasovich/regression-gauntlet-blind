        Gauntlet Shop started in a shared garage in 2017 with one product — a pair of gloves that didn&apos;t soak through on the ride in. Everything we make since then has followed the same rule: build it for the person who rides every day, not the person who rides on Sunday. We ship every order from our workshop in Montréal.

          Our fabrics are bluesign® certified where available, our packaging is paper, and every product carries a lifetime repair promise. The most sustainable jacket is the one you keep wearing.
